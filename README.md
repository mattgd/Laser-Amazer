An educational computer game for the Freshman Engineering Design Day at North Carolina State University. Laser Amazer is a game where the player guides a laser from through the level using geometric mirrors and working around obstacles to reach the end point. For an added challenge, players can race against the clock and try to complete the levels as quickly as possible.

Some features planned for the future of this game include:
* An achievement and trophy system
* Level score based on time
* The ability to collect stars to increase level score
